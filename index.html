		<p> Crop Crcles is an online platform for plant lovers to connect, communicate and swap with one another. Whether you live in an apartment with a small window box or a house with a giant backyard we believe that you can garden, and that we can help you to have a better gardening experience.  
		<p> We provide a planning tool that you can use to design your garden, a notebook to document and share your planting projects and crop crcles you can join or create yourself. A crop crcle is a support group in which you exchange tips, advice, photos, videos and even offline resources like seed and harvest sharing.

			<p> We are in the prototying phase of creating a planning tool for you to use to design your garden.  We will guide you through the process of picking the right crops for your specific situation as well as how to plant your crops.

			<p> Once you have selected your plants and the conditions you will grow them in, we will provide planting times that you can easily add to your calendar for reminders, as well as a list of everything you need. With one click you can send your list out for purchase, simplifying your process even more by telling you exactly where to go to find everything you need.

		<h1>Journal</h2>
		<p> Your journal is a place for you to document your growing experience. You can automatically populate crops from your plan, or add new ones here. Through calendaring, photos, videos and notes you can document the process as you plant, grow and harvest your crops. Add pins and boards from Pinterest to your inspiration section to keep you motivated! 
			
		<p> In future years you can refer back to your journal to improve your growing process.  And you can easily share any part of your journal with your Crop Crcles anytime you want feedback.

		<h1>Crcle</h2>
		<p> We know that gardening is very often a solo experience, and that may very well be what you love most about it.  That's okay, joining a Crop Crcle doesn't come with any obligations. You can share if you want to, you can meet in person and exchange seeds or harvests, but you don't have to. You decide what you're comfortable with and how you want to participate.

		<p> Your Crop Crcles will support you throughout your growing experience from planning to harvesting. You can create your own Crop Crcle by inviting people you know or browse local Crop Crcles and join any that feel relevant to you.

		<p> Post a picture of a sick plant and ask for help, or brag about your newly ripened strawberries. Answering questions and providing useful tips will earn not only the admiration of your fellow gardeners, but also recognition and rewards!

		<p> We think that you'll be pleasantly surprised by just how helpful connecting with regional gardeners will be. You live in a unique ecosystem, with it's own weather and soil issues. Every gardener develops a treasure trove of useful information on how to grow best in their area, and the more you share that information with one another, the better your gardens will grow.

		<h1>About</h2>
		<p> We started this project as a small team of graduate students at BDW, an innovative program in Design, Technology and Entrepreneurship through the University of Colorado, Boulder.  

		<p> We wanted to create something that would help more people to become self-sufficient providers of their own food resources.  We believe that access to fresh, local food is the key to environmental and social health.

		<p> If you're interested in helping us continue this project, please contact us!</p>
